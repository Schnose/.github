This is a collection of projects I work on in my free time. They all revolve around
[CS:GO KZ](https://forum.gokz.org/).

This includes:
- a [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Schnose/DiscordBot)
- a [Twitch Bot](https://github.com/Schnose/TwitchBot)
- a [REST API](https://github.com/Schnose/SchnoseAPI)
- a [GSI Desktop Client](https://github.com/Schnose/GSIClient)

All of these projects were made for fun and to learn programming. None of them (especially
`SchnoseAPI`) are meant to be ran in any serious environment. I do believe that they bring value for
the community and appreciate people using them, as well as feedback for features and/or code
quality.
